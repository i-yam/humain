Aims and Scope
--------------------
  
The HuMaIn Workshop at KI-2024 aims to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and human-centric disciplines such as the social sciences, psychology, and the humanities. Our objective is to explore and foster advancements in AI that enable software and robots to interact with humans in intuitive, respectful, and engaging ways. By bringing together a multidisciplinary mix of researchers, practitioners, and innovators, we will contribute to the solutions to the task of designing AI systems that enrich human life and society. In an era where AI is increasingly becoming part of everyday life, the need for human-machine interfaces to be safe, friendly, intuitive, and relevant has never been more crucial. HuMaIn will elicit submissions on
* Ethical design principles for human-AI interaction,
* Psychological foundations of human-AI interaction,
* Artistic applications of (generative) AI,
* Emerging trends in human-friendly robot and software interfaces, in particular the application of AI in social robotics and healthcare,
* Social science studies of AI applications, in particular with respect to the effect of AI on political discourse on social media.

The relevance of this workshop lies in its potential to catalyze cross-disciplinary innovations that are not only technologically advanced but also socially and psychologically informed. Our goals include
* Fostering a dialogue between AI-engineers, psychologist, and social scientists,
* Highlighting innovative approaches to human-friendly robot and software interfaces,
* Encouraging collaborative research efforts across disciplines,
* Contributing to the roadmap for ethical and effective human-AI interaction.


Target audience and participation
---------------------------------

* Academics and researchers in AI, robotics, social sciences, psychology, and related fields,
* AI and robotics practitioners and developers focused on user experience,
* Policymakers interested in the social implications of AI,
* Students and early-career researchers looking for cutting-edge research directions.

Workshop format and activities
-------------------------------

The workshop is a full-day event that will feature
* Keynote speeches by two leaders in AI, robotics, and human-centric disciplines, by [Prof. Dr. Barbara Bruno](https://sarai.iar.kit.edu/21_58.php), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and by [Dr. Alexei Grinbaum](https://irfu.cea.fr/en/Pisp/alexei.grinbaum/), Centre de recherche CEA Paris-Saclay;
* A panel discussion on interdisciplinary collaborations and possible future directions for human-machine interaction;
* Paper presentations with peer feedback sessions;
* Interactive breakout groups focused on specific themes or challenges.


Submission process and criteria
---------------------------------

Participants are invited to papers related to the workshop themes. Submissions should contain up to 8 pages (for full papers) and up to 4 pages (for short papers) of content excluding references and be formatted according to the [Springer LNCS style](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj). Selection criteria will focus on relevance, originality, and potential to spark interdisciplinary dialogue.
